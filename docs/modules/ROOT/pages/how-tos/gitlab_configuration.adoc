= Configuration for GitLab

The environment variable `DEFAULT_API_SECRET_REF_NAME` can be used to define a default secret name which will be used for tenant's APISecretRef.
Make sure you set this env var to a secret name which exists and contains the following keys:

* `endpoint`: GitLab API endpoint (for example `https://gitlab.com`)
* `token`: GitLab API token to use
* `hostKeys`: SSH keys of GitLab (in `known_hosts` format)

IMPORTANT: Currently the groups and subgroups for git repositories aren't created automatically and need to exist. The GitLab user in the group should have at least `Maintainer` privileges to be able to create, update and delete repositories.
