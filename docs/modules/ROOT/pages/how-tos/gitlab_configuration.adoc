= Configuration for GitLab

Currently the API creates `GitRepo` objects with a hard coded reference for the GitLab API credentials secret. This is subject to change and will be configurable on a per tenant basis (see https://github.com/projectsyn/lieutenant-operator/issues/48[issue #48]). Make sure a secret with the name `vshn-gitlab` exists in the API's namespace. The secret needs the following keys:

* `endpoint`: GitLab API endpoint (for example `https://gitlab.com`)
* `token`: GitLab API token to use
* `hostKeys`: SSH keys of GitLab (in `known_hosts` format)

IMPORTANT: Currently the groups and subgroups for git repositories aren't created automatically and need to exist. The GitLab user in the group should have at least `Maintainer` privileges to be able to create, update and delete repositories.
