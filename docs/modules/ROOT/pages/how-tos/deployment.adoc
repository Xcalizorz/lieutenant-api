= Deployment

The Lieutenant API is meant to be deployed on a Kubernetes cluster. It needs to be the same cluster it uses as a back end to store the CRs.

The xref:lieutenant-operator::index.adoc[Lieutenant Operator] needs to be deployed on the cluster and with it the accompanying CRDs. Make sure the operator watches objects in the namespace where the API is being deployed.

You can find a https://kustomize.io[Kustomize] setup for a deployment in the `deploy/` folder. A role and service account will be created for the API. The `Cluster` and `Tenant` CRs will be stored in the same namespace as the API is deployed.
