This is the documentation of the Lieutenant API. Also see the xref:syn:SDDs:0007-lieutenant-management-api.adoc[SDD 0007 - Lieutenant - Management API] for more information.


== Introduction

The Lieutenant API is the central inventory of all clusters managed by Project Syn. It's the main entrypoint to interact with them and query for their status.

It's mainly a wraper around the various CRDs of the xref:lieutenant-operator::index.adoc[Lieutenant Operator] and makes its usage easier.

== API Authentication

=== Bearer Token

Authentication to the API is handled via https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#service-account-tokens[Kubernetes service account tokens]. Except for the `/docs`, `/healthz` and `/install/steward.json` endpoints, every request must contain a bearer token. The HTTP header `Authorization` must be set to `Bearer <token>` with `<token>` beign a valid https://jwt.io/[JWT token]. This JWT token will then be used by the API to authenticate against the Kubernetes cluster.

=== Bootstrap Token

The `/install/steward.json` endpoint must provide a query parameter `token` which contains the bootstrap token of a cluster. Such a token can only be used once and has a short (for example ~30 minutes) expiry time. The API uses it's own service account to authenticate to Kubernetes and search the clusters for the provided bootstrap token. Once a cluster is found and the bootstrap token is still valid, the installation manifests will be returned and the token marked invalid.

=== API Service Account

The API needs a service account to communicate with Kubernetes. This service account should have the minimum required rights to search for clusters, mark bootstrap tokens as invalid and read a cluster's service account token.
Such an RBAC `Role` is included in the xref:deployment.adoc[deployment manifests].


== API Authorization

With the exception of the `/install/steward.json` endpoint, authorization of all API requests is fully delegated to the Kubernetes cluster. The provided bearer token will be used to make requests to the Kubernetes API.
